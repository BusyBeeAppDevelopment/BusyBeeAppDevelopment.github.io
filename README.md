Do you like our page?   Would you like to see how it is made?

Bootstrap - is our current single page html for BusyBeeDenver.com

SNT - is a single page apllication using JQuery.   It is intended to be deployed on a simple XAMP/LAMP/MAMP Stack and run as local host.  
You could then connect an inexpensive touch screen to create an E-kiosk.  Email me if you have question on securing this.  schuyler.ankele@gmail.com

As we spiff up the company page there will be more to see here.
